# Working with stable_baseline & gym library

in this notebook we're going to work with `stable_baseline` and `gym` library in order to train an agent which can land safly on earth in `Lunar-Lander` environment by using `PPO` algorithm.

- this mini project is for hugging face [deep-RL course](https://huggingface.co/deep-rl-course/unit0/introduction?fw=pt).
