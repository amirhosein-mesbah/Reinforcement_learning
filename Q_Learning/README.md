# Q-Learning with FrozenLake-v1 â›„ and Taxi-v3 ðŸš•

In this notebook we're going to code Q-Learning algorithm from scrath and experiment different configurations.

- this notenook is part of Hands-On for unit2 of Hugging-Face [Deep RL course](https://huggingface.co/deep-rl-course/unit2/introduction?fw=pt) 

### ðŸŽ® Environments: 

- [FrozenLake-v1](https://www.gymlibrary.dev/environments/toy_text/frozen_lake/)
- [Taxi-v3](https://www.gymlibrary.dev/environments/toy_text/taxi/)


  


## Results
